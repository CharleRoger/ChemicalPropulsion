  - Added `ModuleIgnitionEngineController`, `ModuleIgnitionRCSController` and `ModuleIgnitionTankController` where applicable

# 0.5.1
- Added a last-ditch compatibility patch which replaces LiquidFuel and MonoPropellant in unpatched engines with Hydrazine... I imagine this will have unintended consequences but I haven't run into any yet
- Realigned MissingHistory's "Pug" and "Valiant" engines to have identical stats with their Restock+ counterparts

  - LqdAmmonia: `ThrustMultiplier 0.6; IspMultiplier 1.2`, c.f. ammonilox `~0.931; ~0.978`

  - Monopropellant: HTP—Hydrazine
  - Keroxide: Kerosene / HTP
  - Hypergolic: Hydrazine—Pentaborane / NTO-N2F4
  - Ammonilox: LqdAmmonia / LqdOxygen-LqdFluorine (currently unassigned, but can be used in NTRs with an oxidizer-augmented mode)
  - Kerolox: Kerosene / LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
  - Methalox: LqdMethane—Diborane / LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
  - Hydrolox: LqdHydrogen / LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
- Changed two engines from kerolox to hypergolic type, since there were not many hypergolic engines assigned after the introduction of keroxide:
  - LV-TX87 "Bobcat" (Making History), since it's based on the LR-87 which was used with hypergolic propellants for most of its history
  - RE-L20 "Labrador" (Labradoodle), since it kind of looks like an RD-170 and same as above
- Assigned keroxide type to basic stock and Restock+ liquid fuel engines:
  - LV-1R "Spider"
  - 24-77 "Twitch"
  - Mk-55 "Thud"
  - LV-1 "Ant"
  - 48-7S "Spark"
  - LV-T30 "Reliant"

# 0.4.0

- Rewrote a good chunk of the patches using new FuelMixer plugin (0.1.0) to handle monopropellant and bipropellant fuel tanks, engines and RCS
- Changed fuel mixtures available on bipropellant engine types:
  - Monopropellant: HTP—Hydrazine
  - Hypergolic: LqdAmmonia—Hydrazine—Pentaborane / NTO
  - Kerolox: Kerosene / HTP—LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
  - Methalox: LqdMethane—Diborane / LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
  - Hydrolox: LqdHydrogen / LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
- Changed fuel cells to only use LqdHydrogen+LqdOxygen and ISRU to only deal with LqdHydrogen, LqdOxygen, LqdMethane and HTP in order to balance the more effective propellants by the lack of ISRU, and in preparation for Chemical Conversion which will handle all of this more comprehensively
- Various tidying of code and small fixes
# 0.3.0
- Introduced HTP as a basic monopropellant and Kerosene/HTP as a basic hypergolic bipropellant
- Added switches to engines, tanks, RCS for a pair of "basic" and "advanced" (higher Isp, more expensive) propellants for the five liquid engine types:
  - Monopropellant: HTP — Hydrazine
  - Hypergolic: Kerosene/HTP — Hydrazine/NTO
  - Kerolox: Kerosene/LqdOxygen — Pentaborane/LqdFluorine
  - Methalox: LqdMethane/LqdOxygen — Diborane/LqdFluorine
  - Hydrolox: LqdHydrogen/LqdOxygen — LqdHydrogen/LqdFluorine
- Removed Hydrazine and NTO recipes from ISRU in favour of a consistency (only basic propellants allowed)
- Changed everything to use Immersive Chemical Core 0.3.0 common resource colours
- Added common propellant ratios used throughout all patches
- Restored original stats for the LV-T30 "Reliant" and the LV-T45 "Swivel", since the lower-Isp constraint on low tech engines is now handled by the use of Kerosene/HTP (note that no tech restrictions actually exist yet)
- Balanced Restock+'s Pug against other hypergolic engines:
  - LV-303 'Pug' Liquid Fuel Engine [250-330 → 220-310s]

- Added native RCS bipropellant switch for more control. Replaces existing switches, e.g. the one provided by Near Future Launch Vehicles

- Added support for VABOrganizer, with new categories for different types of engine and RCS. This adds subcategorisation to many parts which didn't already have any, including tanks

- Fixed tank type patch ordering

# 0.1.3
- Improved propellant type assignment targeting, should fix some odd cases where copies of parts inherit the wrong propellant type
- Changed engine name replacement to use terms which characterise the propellant combination: "Kerolox", "Methalox" and "Hydrolox"

- Add descriptions to propellant combinations, only used in RCS switches at the moment
- Added MissingHistory support:
  - LV-303 "Pug": Hypergolic, stats unchanged
  - LV-T15 "Valiant": Hypergolic, stats unchanged
  - Other engines handled automatically
- Added Labradoodle support:
  - RE-L20 "Labrador": Kerolox, stats unchanged
# 0.1.2
- Fixed catch-all engine type patch which converts all not-directly-supported engines into Hydrazine/NTO
- Added simple regex which replaces "Liquid Fuel" in engine titles with "Hypergolic", "Kerosene", "Liquid Hydrogen", "Liquid Methane" or "Kero-Hydro-Lox" (ideally this would hook into localisation, but only supports English for now)
- Replaced MonoPropellant with Hydrazine in tanks contained in B9 part switches, e.g. the integrated tanks on the orbital maneuvering engines from Near Future Spacecraft
# 0.1.1
- Fixed patches targeting presence of MakingHistory with ModuleManager NEEDS
- Changed Kerbodyne KR-2L+ "Rhino" to use LqdHydrogen/LqdOxygen since it makes a good Aerojet M-1 analogue, which is seemingly how Restock treats it, with performance balanced accordingly:
  - 1750kN, 310-430s
- Balanced hydrolox engines:
  - Making History RE-I2 "Skiff" / Restock+ RE-I2 'Caravel': 300/510kN → 31kN, 1.6/2t → 1.4t (30% thrust scaled J-2 analogue)
  - S3 KS-25 "Vector": 1000kN → 675kN, 4t → 3t (30% thrust scaled RS-25 analogue)
  - S3 KS-25x4 "Mammoth": 4000kN → 2700kN, 15t → 12t (4x S3 KS-25 "Vector")
  - CryoEngines CE-60 'Tharsis': 360kN → 320kN, 3t → 2.4t (2x CE-60 'Pavonis')
  - Restock+ KR-10A 'Corgi': 750kN → 220kN, 5.25t → 2.2t (4x CryoEngines CE-10 'Hecate')
- Balanced hypergolic engines:
  - LV-T30 "Reliant": Vacuum 310s → 300s (Minor adjustment to balance against other hypergolic engines)
  - LV-T45 "Swivel": Vacuum 320s → 310s (Minor adjustment to balance against other hypergolic engines)
  - RE-J10 "Wolfhound": 375kN → 110kN, 3.3t → 0.8t (Restock+ RE-137 'Schnauzer' stats, which are much more sensible)

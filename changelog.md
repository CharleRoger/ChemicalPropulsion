  - Added `ModuleIgnitionEngineController`, `ModuleIgnitionRCSController` and `ModuleIgnitionTankController` where applicable

  - LqdAmmonia: `ThrustMultiplier 0.6; IspMultiplier 1.2`, c.f. ammonilox `~0.931; ~0.978`

  - Kerolox: Kerosene / LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
  - Methalox: LqdMethane—Diborane / LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
  - Hydrolox: LqdHydrogen / LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
- Changed two engines from kerolox to hypergolic type, since there were not many hypergolic engines assigned after the introduction of keroxide:
  - LV-TX87 "Bobcat" (Making History), since it's based on the LR-87 which was used with hypergolic propellants for most of its history
  - RE-L20 "Labrador" (Labradoodle), since it kind of looks like an RD-170 and same as above
- Assigned keroxide type to basic stock and Restock+ liquid fuel engines:
  - LV-1R "Spider"
  - 24-77 "Twitch"
  - Mk-55 "Thud"

  - Monopropellant: HTP—Hydrazine
  - Hypergolic: LqdAmmonia—Hydrazine—Pentaborane / NTO
  - Kerolox: Kerosene / HTP—LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
  - Methalox: LqdMethane—Diborane / LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
  - Hydrolox: LqdHydrogen / LqdOxygen—LqdFluorine
- Changed fuel cells to only use LqdHydrogen+LqdOxygen and ISRU to only deal with LqdHydrogen, LqdOxygen, LqdMethane and HTP in order to balance the more effective propellants by the lack of ISRU, and in preparation for Chemical Conversion which will handle all of this more comprehensively
- Various tidying of code and small fixes
# 0.3.0
- Introduced HTP as a basic monopropellant and Kerosene/HTP as a basic hypergolic bipropellant
- Added switches to engines, tanks, RCS for a pair of "basic" and "advanced" (higher Isp, more expensive) propellants for the five liquid engine types:
  - Monopropellant: HTP — Hydrazine
  - Hypergolic: Kerosene/HTP — Hydrazine/NTO
  - Kerolox: Kerosene/LqdOxygen — Pentaborane/LqdFluorine
  - Methalox: LqdMethane/LqdOxygen — Diborane/LqdFluorine
  - Hydrolox: LqdHydrogen/LqdOxygen — LqdHydrogen/LqdFluorine
- Removed Hydrazine and NTO recipes from ISRU in favour of a consistency (only basic propellants allowed)
- Changed everything to use Immersive Chemical Core 0.3.0 common resource colours
- Added common propellant ratios used throughout all patches

  - LV-303 'Pug' Liquid Fuel Engine [250-330 → 220-310s]

- Added native RCS bipropellant switch for more control. Replaces existing switches, e.g. the one provided by Near Future Launch Vehicles

- Fixed tank type patch ordering

- Added simple regex which replaces "Liquid Fuel" in engine titles with "Hypergolic", "Kerosene", "Liquid Hydrogen", "Liquid Methane" or "Kero-Hydro-Lox" (ideally this would hook into localisation, but only supports English for now)
- Replaced MonoPropellant with Hydrazine in tanks contained in B9 part switches, e.g. the integrated tanks on the orbital maneuvering engines from Near Future Spacecraft
# 0.1.1
- Fixed patches targeting presence of MakingHistory with ModuleManager NEEDS
- Changed Kerbodyne KR-2L+ "Rhino" to use LqdHydrogen/LqdOxygen since it makes a good Aerojet M-1 analogue, which is seemingly how Restock treats it, with performance balanced accordingly:

- Balanced hydrolox engines:
  - Making History RE-I2 "Skiff" / Restock+ RE-I2 'Caravel': 300/510kN → 31kN, 1.6/2t → 1.4t (30% thrust scaled J-2 analogue)
  - S3 KS-25 "Vector": 1000kN → 675kN, 4t → 3t (30% thrust scaled RS-25 analogue)
  - S3 KS-25x4 "Mammoth": 4000kN → 2700kN, 15t → 12t (4x S3 KS-25 "Vector")

  - Restock+ KR-10A 'Corgi': 750kN → 220kN, 5.25t → 2.2t (4x CryoEngines CE-10 'Hecate')
- Balanced hypergolic engines:
  - LV-T30 "Reliant": Vacuum 310s → 300s (Minor adjustment to balance against other hypergolic engines)
  - LV-T45 "Swivel": Vacuum 320s → 310s (Minor adjustment to balance against other hypergolic engines)
  - RE-J10 "Wolfhound": 375kN → 110kN, 3.3t → 0.8t (Restock+ RE-137 'Schnauzer' stats, which are much more sensible)

- Changed MonoPropellant RCS to use Hydrazine
- Changed LiquidFuel/Oxidizer RCS to use Hydrazine/NTO
- Changed Near Future Launch Vehicles multimode bipropellant RCS to use Hydrazine/NTO, Kerosene/LqdOxygen, LqdHydrogen/LqdOxygen and LqdMethane/LqdOxygen
- Replaced all Ore → MonoPropellant ModuleResourceConverter recipes to Ore → Hydrazine:
- Replaced all Ore → LiquidFuel/LqdHydrogen/LqdMethane + Oxidizer ModuleResourceConverter recipes to the following:
  - Ore → Hydrazine
  - Ore → NTO
  - Ore → Hydrazine + NTO
  - Ore → Kerosene
  - Ore → LqdOxygen
  - Ore → Kerosene + LqdOxygen
  - Ore → LqdHydrogen
  - Ore → LqdHydrogen + LqdOxygen
  - Ore → LqdMethane
  - Ore → LqdMethane + LqdOxygen
